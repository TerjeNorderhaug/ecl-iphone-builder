ECL Build Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running git-clone, open a shell in the ecl-iphone-builder
directory.

The following script assumes the sources were unpacked in the /opt/src
directory.

  cd /opt/src/ecl-iphone-builder
  wget http://softlayer.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ecls/ecls/9.8/ecl-9.8.4.tgz
  wget http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/gc-7.2alpha2.tar.gz
  tar xzf gc-7.2alpha2.tar.gz
  cd gc-7.2alpha2/
  patch -p1 < ../gc-patch.txt
  cd ..
  tar xzf ecl-9.8.4.tgz
  cd ecl-9.8.4/
  patch -p1 < ../ecl-patch.txt
  cd src
  mv gc gc.orig
  ln -s ../../gc-7.2alpha2 gc
  cd ..

Now comes the actual build:

  ../build.sh --install ../iphone

Get yourself a cup of coffee, while this runs. When it's done, there
should be an iphone/ sub-directory in the build/directory, with the
following contents:

  device/bin/...
  device/include/...
  device/lib/...
  simulator/bin/...
  simulator/include/...
  simulator/lib/...
  universal/lib/libbytecmp.a
  universal/lib/libecl.a
  universal/lib/libeclgc.a
  universal/lib/libeclgmp.a
  universal/lib/libserve-event.a
  universal/lib/libsockets.a
  
The universal/lib/lib* contain FAT binaries of the static libraries,
which makes it easy to configure the Xcode project.


eclshell Build Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and setup a SLIME source directory. The swank-ecl-patches.txt
has been submitted to the SLIME maintainers, and hopefully it will
make it into the CVS builds one of these days, and the patch step will
not be required.

  cd ../eclshell
  wget http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/snapshots/slime-current.tgz
  tar xzf slime-current.tgz
  ln -s slime-[0-9]* slime
  cd slime
  patch -p0 < ../../swank-ecl-patches.txt
  cd ..

Building the eclshell example requires a native ECL build on the host
OSX system. Configure the path to the ecl directory in the makefile.

  make			# see makefile for configuring ecl path

That should generate a libeclffi.a fat library. Now open
eclshell.xcodeproj and run a Simulator or Device build. Hopefully it
will just work, and there will be some noisy output as SLIME loads,
ending eventually with:

;; Swank started at port: 4005.

From a local emacs, run M-x slime-connect, to 127.0.0.1 (if running a
Simulator build, for device builds look at the IP address listed on
the device), port 4005.

Happy hacking.
